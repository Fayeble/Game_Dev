# Cages_of_the_Forgotten 
Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for a top-down game developed by a small student team as part of a school project. 
The game is built using GameMaker 2024.400 and is being released publicly to encourage learning, collaboration, and improvement. 
We hope that by sharing our work, others can learn from our development process and contribute to enhancing the game further. 
Feel free to explore the code, offer feedback, and suggest improvements!
